When we first saw the Notecard from [Blues Wireless](https://blues.io/) we were intrigued. Unlike most embedded cellular modems, the price of the Blues Wireless card includes a 10 year subscription and 500MB of data. A global cellular module with a built in SIM card with no monthly fee? That sounds enticing. After all, the last thing we need is a hot water heater monitor with a monthly cell phone bill!

The power of Qwiic just keeps expanding! Simply plug the Qwiic Cellular Notecarrier onto any enabled SparkFun Qwiic platforms (currently [over 30](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#products)) and youâ€™ll be able to transmit data anywhere there is cell connectivity with a few lines of Python, Arduino, or JSON. The Blues documentation is superb. All [API calls](https://dev.blues.io/reference/notecard-api/) come with extensive C, Python, and JSON examples. While the Qwiic Cellular focuses on using the I2C bus for communication, USB and Serial can also be used to communicate with the Notecard. We found the USB was handy for immediate gratification and command debugging.

The Notecard module comes with integrated cellular, SIM, onboard GPS, accelerometer, and temperature sensor. The Qwiic Cellular product has everything you need: a carrier board (Blues calls them Notepads), the globally enabled [NB-IoT & LTE-M](https://shop.blues.io/products/note-nbgl-500) M.2 based module (Blues calls them Notecards), and two U.FL cables all assembled and ready to go.

Currently 139 countries are covered with another 33 countries covered by installing a user-supplied external SIM socket and card. See the [Covered Countries](https://dev.blues.io/hardware/notecard-datasheet/note-nbgl-500/#cellular-and-gps-gnss-antenna-requirements) table for more information. Two RF cables connect the Notecard to external SMA connectors for cellular and GPS antennas (sold separately in related items below).
